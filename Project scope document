PROJECT SCOPE DOCUMENT
1.PROJECT SUMMARY:
A typical Regression Machine Learning  project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future .This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

Life Expectancy  is a statistical measue of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors : Regional variations, Economic Circumstacnes, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses ,Physical Illnesses , Education, Year of the ir birth ans other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.
